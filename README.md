# trials
data recording relationships between trials moves and skills

files are in draft, data structure is in draft, all of this can be moved and changed if we find a better solution.

add an id number to everything.
only add parent (preceding/preceded_by) and sibling (like, similar, etc.) relationships, not two way.

it looks like a graph will be the most useful way to visualise the relationships

potentially use these tools and data definitions:
    graphviz: https://graphviz.gitlab.io/
    gephi: https://gephi.org/
